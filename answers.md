- **2) The work recurrence is W(n) = W(n-1) + W(n-2) + c and this is O(2^n).**

- **3) The span recurrence is Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2) and this is O(n).**

- **4) In the counts list, the ratio between entries is about 1.62 (ex: 55/34 =1.62, 34/21 = 1.62, etc.**

- **6) The maximum times fib_top_down(i) will be called for any i is i times. The span in still O(n) but the work is now also O(n)**

- **8) The maximum times Fi will be read for any value i is i times. The span is O(n) and the work is O(n).**
